Let me introduce you to my party people in the club, huh
It's a new generation of party people
Get 'em up, yeah
If you go hard, you gotta get on the floor
If you're a party freak, then step on the floor
If you're an animal, then tear up the floor
Break a sweat on the floor
Yeah, we work on the floor
Don't stop, keep it moving, put your drinks up
Pick your body up and drop it on the floor
Let the rhythm change your world on the floor
You know we're running shit tonight on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to LA, New York, Vegas to Africa
Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
I know you got it, clap your hands on the floor
And keep on rocking, rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor, on the floor
Don't stop, keep it moving, put your drinks up
It's getting ill, it's getting sick on the floor
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I ain't wrong, we'll probably die on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to LA, New York, Vegas to Africa
Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
Break it off
Kick it out
Raise the roof
Wreck the dancehall
Rip these walls
Light it up
Make some noise, oh
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor

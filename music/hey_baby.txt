El que no oye consejo, no llega viejo
So listen up
Let her go, la-la-la-la
If your girl wanna play, let her go (Ah-ha)
Said let her go, la-la-la-la
If your girl wanna play, let her go (Ah-ha)
Said let her go, la-la-la-la (Ah-ha)
If your girl wanna play, let her go (Ah-ha)
Said let her go, la-la-la-la
If your girl wanna play, let her go
Dále, Pain

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
Hey, baby girl, what you doin' tonight?
I wanna see what you got in store (Hey, hey, baby)
You're giving it your all when you're dancin' on me
I wanna see if you can gimme some more (Hey, hey, baby)
You can be my girl, I can be your man
And we can pump this jam however you want (Hey, hey, baby)
Pump it from the side, pump it upside down
Or we can pump it from the back and the front (Hey, hey, baby)

[Chorus: Pitbull & T-Pain]
Ooh, baby, baby, la-la-la-la-la-la-la (Ah-ha)
Ooh, baby, baby, la-la-la-la-la-la-la (Ah-ha)
Ooh, baby, baby, la-la-la-la

I get wet at the thought of you
Being a responsible guy
Treating me like you're supposed to do
Tears run down my thighs
A little initiative can go a very long long way
Baby just do the dishes
I'll give you what you (what you), what you want
A little communication yes that's my ideal foreplay
Assemble a chair from IKEA
I'm like (uhhh)
I get wet at the thought of you
Being a responsible guy
Treating me like you're supposed to do
Tears run down my thighs
A little respect for women can get you very very far
Remembering how to use your phone gets me
Oh so, oh so, oh so hot
Considering I have feelings I'm like, why are my clothes still on?
Offering to do anything I'm like (oh my God)
I get wet at the thought of you
Being a responsible guy
Treating me like you're supposed to do
Tears run down my thighs
I get wet at the thought of you
Being a responsible guy
Treating me like you're supposed to do
Tears run down my thighs
(Dance break)
I get wet at the thought of you
Being a responsible guy
Treating me like you're supposed to do
Tears run down my thighs
